# Scraping Stock News from Google and Yahoo Finance

With bigger gains than a bodybuilder on steroids (but not for long...), who wouldn't want to invest in the stock market right now?
I'm a daily reader of financial news and I thought it would be nice to have a place to get the news on **only** the companies I'm interested in.
This is also the beginning of my semester with HackCville Node, a data science program that will teach me a whole new array of skills,
and I'm excited to learn more Python and see where I can take this project.
