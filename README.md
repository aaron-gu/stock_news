# Scraping Stock News from Google and Yahoo Finance

With bigger gains than a bodybuilder on steroids (but not for much longer...), who wouldn't want to invest in the stock market right now?
I'm a daily reader of financial news and I thought it would be nice to have a place to get the news on **only** the companies I'm interested in. I'm writing this Python script with Beautiful Soup 4 in Jupyter Notebook. I'm not sure where this will go, but one idea I have is to try putting this program on my iPhone using Xcode.

__Side note__: This is also the beginning of my semester with HackCville Node, a data science program that will teach me a whole new array of skills, and I'm excited to learn more Python and start exploring more complex projects. I'm hoping that this project will really blossom with the resources and mentorship I'll have.
